# Level 5: The Corrupted Springs

## Theme

The fifth level occupies what was once a sacred site of healing, now transformed into a nightmare of corruption and disease. Located 500 feet below the surface, this level consists of 32 rooms centered around the ancient spring complex. The air here is thick with moisture and carries a sickly-sweet smell of decay mixed with sulfur.

## History

Originally a sacred site where natural hot springs bubbled up from deep underground, channeling warm mineral waters into carved stone pools where pilgrims came to heal their ailments. The priests who tended the springs believed the waters emerged from a blessed source deep within the earth. 

Unknown to them, their excavations to expand the pools eventually broke through into primordial caverns below, where ancient corruption had been sealed away since before human memory. This darkness began seeping upward through the sacred waters, slowly transforming the healing springs into pools of mutation and disease, corrupting both the faithful priests and their desperate patients into the first generation of the dungeon's horrors.

## Key Elements

- **The Corrupted Pools**: Seven stone basins of varying sizes, each filled with waters that cause different mutations
- **Divine Corruption**: The transformation of sacred healing into profane mutation
- **Ancient Seals**: Evidence of the primordial prison that was breached
- **Living Disease**: Corruption that spreads with purpose and intelligence

## Unique Features

- **The Seven Pools**: Each corrupted spring causes different transformations
- **The Steam Tunnels**: Natural vents that release toxic vapors
- **The Pilgrim Quarters**: Former dormitories now inhabited by the transformed
- **The Iron Foundry**: Workshop of the Iron Inquisition
- **The High Altar**: Where healing prayers were offered, now a shrine to corruption
- **The Seal Chamber**: Where the ancient barrier was breached

## Inhabitants

### The Blessed Corrupted
Former pilgrims who came seeking healing but were transformed by the tainted waters. Their bodies show horrific combinations of disease and "healing" - tumorous growths that pulse with vitality, wounds that never close but grant supernatural strength, flesh that constantly regenerates in wrong ways. They believe they've been blessed and seek to share their "gift" by forcing others into the corrupted pools.

**Leader**: Father Grotius (8 HD, AC 2, regenerates 3 hp/round)

### The Iron Inquisition
Constructed beings of black iron and clockwork, created by a long-dead civilization to contain supernatural threats. They've been dormant for centuries but reactivated when the corruption breached its ancient seals. They're immune to the transformative waters and seek to systematically exterminate all organic life on the level before sealing it with molten metal.

**Leader**: Inquisitor Prime (10 HD, AC 0, immune to magic)

## Environmental Hazards

- **Toxic Steam**: Save vs. poison when entering steam-filled areas
- **Corrupted Waters**: Each pool has unique mutation effects
- **Diseased Air**: Extended exposure risks infection
- **Unstable Floors**: Areas weakened by centuries of moisture

## Special Mechanics

**Pool Mutations**: Each of the seven pools causes different transformations:
1. Pool of Flesh: Causes uncontrolled growth
2. Pool of Bone: Hardens skin to armor-like shell
3. Pool of Mind: Grants psychic abilities but madness
4. Pool of Blood: Creates vampiric hunger
5. Pool of Decay: Grants undead traits
6. Pool of Change: Random mutations each round
7. The Source Pool: Full transformation into Blessed Corrupted

## Connections

- **From Level 4**: A narrow spiral staircase behind a rusted iron door, guarded by two Iron Sentinels
- **To Level 6**: A flooded shaft in the deepest pool, requiring underwater navigation
- **Secret**: An ancient maintenance tunnel leads directly to Level 3, bypassing Level 4

## Wandering Monsters

Roll 1d6 every 2 turns:
1. Blessed Corrupted (1d4)
2. Iron Sentinel
3. Diseased Rats (2d6)
4. Steam Mephit
5. Mutant Pilgrims (1d3)
6. Corrupted Priest

## Treasure

This level contains significant wealth donated by pilgrims over centuries, now scattered among the ruins. Estimated total value: 45,000 gp in coins, gems, and healing-related magic items (many now cursed). The Iron Inquisition also guards ancient technological artifacts.

## Narrative Purpose

This is the heart of the dungeon's corruption - where the descent from frozen preservation through emotional and physical transformation reaches its ultimate conclusion. The level reveals the source of all the horror above: not malevolence, but misguided faith that breached barriers meant to remain sealed. The conflict between the Blessed Corrupted and Iron Inquisition presents a choice with no good answers.

## Temperature

Hot and humid, with scalding steam in many areas. The corrupted springs maintain their geothermal heat, creating an oppressive, swamp-like atmosphere. Visibility is often limited by steam, and metal equipment quickly develops rust. The heat is a stark contrast to the frozen entrance five levels above.
