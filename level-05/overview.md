# The History of the Dungeon

## The Deepest Layer: The Healing Springs

Originally a sacred site where natural hot springs bubbled up from deep underground, channeling warm mineral waters into carved stone pools where pilgrims came to heal their ailments. The priests who tended the springs believed the waters emerged from a blessed source deep within the earth. 

Unknown to them, their excavations to expand the pools eventually broke through into primordial caverns below, where ancient corruption had been sealed away since before human memory. This darkness began seeping upward through the sacred waters, slowly transforming the healing springs into pools of mutation and disease, corrupting both the faithful priests and their desperate patients into the first generation of the dungeon's horrors.
