# Level 5: The Corrupted Springs

## Overview

The fifth level of the dungeon occupies what was once a sacred site of healing, now transformed into a nightmare of corruption and disease. Located 500 feet below the surface, this level consists of 32 rooms centered around the ancient spring complex. The air here is thick with moisture and carries a sickly-sweet smell of decay mixed with sulfur.

## History

Originally a sacred site where natural hot springs bubbled up from deep underground, channeling warm mineral waters into carved stone pools where pilgrims came to heal their ailments. The priests who tended the springs believed the waters emerged from a blessed source deep within the earth. 

Unknown to them, their excavations to expand the pools eventually broke through into primordial caverns below, where ancient corruption had been sealed away since before human memory. This darkness began seeping upward through the sacred waters, slowly transforming the healing springs into pools of mutation and disease, corrupting both the faithful priests and their desperate patients into the first generation of the dungeon's horrors.

## Major Features

- **The Corrupted Pools**: Seven stone basins of varying sizes, each filled with waters that cause different mutations
- **The Steam Tunnels**: Natural vents that release toxic vapors, requiring saves vs. poison
- **The Pilgrim Quarters**: Former dormitories now inhabited by the transformed
- **The Iron Foundry**: Workshop of the Iron Inquisition, filled with half-constructed sentinels

## Factions

### The Blessed Corrupted
Former pilgrims who came seeking healing but were transformed by the tainted waters. Their bodies show horrific combinations of disease and "healing" - tumorous growths that pulse with vitality, wounds that never close but grant supernatural strength, flesh that constantly regenerates in wrong ways. They believe they've been blessed and seek to share their "gift" by forcing others into the corrupted pools.

**Leader**: Father Grotius (8 HD, AC 2, regenerates 3 hp/round)

### The Iron Inquisition
Constructed beings of black iron and clockwork, created by a long-dead civilization to contain supernatural threats. They've been dormant for centuries but reactivated when the corruption breached its ancient seals. They're immune to the transformative waters and seek to systematically exterminate all organic life on the level before sealing it with molten metal.

**Leader**: Inquisitor Prime (10 HD, AC 0, immune to magic)

## Connections

- **From Level 4**: A narrow spiral staircase behind a rusted iron door, guarded by two Iron Sentinels
- **To Level 6**: A flooded shaft in the deepest pool, requiring underwater navigation
- **Secret**: An ancient maintenance tunnel leads directly to Level 3, bypassing Level 4
