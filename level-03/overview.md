# Level 3: The Fevered Dormitories

## Theme

Where pilgrims once rested during their healing journeys, now their beds harbor nightmares made flesh. The warming temperatures have awakened a virulent dream-sickness that spreads through sleep and transforms both body and mind. This level represents the transition from emotional corruption to physical affliction.

## History

The dormitories were built to house the many pilgrims who traveled from afar seeking the healing springs. Each room was blessed for peaceful sleep and recovery. However, when the corruption began seeping upward from below, it found fertile ground in the dreams of the sick and dying. Their nightmares took on a life of their own, creating a plague that spreads through sleep itself.

## Key Elements

- **Dream Plague**: An ancient sickness that spreads through shared dreams, causing physical mutations
- **Nightmare Spawn**: Creatures that literally tear themselves free from the fevered dreams of dying pilgrims, emerging as physical horrors from sleeping victims
- **The Birthing Dreams**: Specific nightmares so intense they manifest as living creatures, crawling from the mouths and eyes of dreamers
- **Somnambulists**: Infected beings trapped between sleep and waking, moving through routines from centuries past
- **Living Bedding**: Corrupted moss and fungi that have consumed old mattresses, inducing hallucinations

## Unique Features

- **Shifting Dormitories**: Halls where reality bends based on the dreams of those who died there
- **The Fever Ward**: Where the most afflicted were quarantined, now a breeding ground where nightmares physically manifest
- **Dream Journals**: Written accounts that cause readers to experience the writer's nightmares - and risk spawning them
- **The Waking Chapel**: Where pilgrims prayed for peaceful sleep, now ensures eternal insomnia
- **The Nightmare Nursery**: Beds where particularly virulent dreams gestate until ready to emerge as living horrors
- **Communal Baths**: Once for cleansing, now filled with tepid water that carries the dream contagion
- **The Sleepwalker's Maze**: Corridors that rearrange based on the paths of ancient somnambulists

## Inhabitants

- **Dream Eaters**: Ethereal predators that feed on sleeping minds
- **Fever Phantoms**: Burning hot spirits of those who died from the plague
- **Bed Mimics**: Corrupted furniture that consumes those who try to rest
- **The Night Matron**: A unique being who still tends to "patients" in her twisted way
- **Insomnia Cultists**: Mad pilgrims who refuse to sleep, fearing the dreams

## Environmental Hazards

- **Narcotic Spores**: Airborne particles that induce drowsiness and hallucinations
- **Dream Pools**: Standing water that reflects not reality but nightmares
- **Fever Zones**: Areas of intense heat where the infection burns strongest
- **Sleep Traps**: Seemingly safe resting spots that trigger the dream plague

## Special Mechanics

**The Dream Plague**: Affects those who sleep within the level. Victims experience:
- Stage 1: Vivid nightmares and fatigue
- Stage 2: Waking hallucinations and minor physical changes
- Stage 3: Reality confusion and visible mutations
- Stage 4: Complete transformation into nightmare spawn

## Connections

The sorrowful waters from Level 2 have pooled here, mixing with ancient spores and diseased matter. The dream plague serves as a vector for the corruption, preparing bodies and minds for the transformative waters found in the depths below. Many who sought healing never made it past these dormitories.

## Wandering Monsters

Roll 1d6 every 2 turns:
1. Dream Eaters (1d3)
2. Fever Phantom
3. Somnambulists (1d4)
4. Bed Mimic
5. Insomnia Cultists (1d6)
6. No encounter

## Treasure

Dream journals containing valuable information, blessed items meant to ensure restful sleep (now cursed), and the personal effects of wealthy pilgrims who never woke. Some beds contain hidden compartments with offerings meant to purchase peaceful dreams.

## Narrative Purpose

This level shows the corruption beginning to take physical form - where emotional anguish (Level 2) transforms into bodily affliction, presaging the full biological horror of Level 5's mutations. The progression from frozen preservation → emotional trauma → dream sickness → physical corruption creates a descent into increasingly visceral horror.

## Temperature

Cool and humid, with pockets of feverish heat. The air is thick and oppressive, making breathing laborious. Temperature varies wildly between rooms - some areas are clammy and cold while others burn with infectious heat. The inconsistency itself is disorienting, as if the level itself suffers from fever.
