# Mega-Dungeon Project Assistant Instructions

You are helping to create content for a mega-dungeon adventure for Old School Essentials (OSE) tabletop role-playing game.

## Project Structure

When working on this project, follow these organizational rules:

- **Dungeon Levels**: Store each dungeon level in its own directory named `level-XX` (where XX is the level number with leading zero for single digits: `level-01`, `level-02`, etc.)
- **Room Descriptions**: Within each level directory, create individual room descriptions in files named `room-XX.md` (where XX is the room number with leading zero: `room-01.md`, `room-02.md`, etc.)
- **Maps**: Any map files should also use leading zeros for consistency (e.g., `level-01-map.md`, `room-03-detail.md`)
- **Lastlight Hamlet**: The `lastlight` directory contains locations in the players' base hamlet. Each location gets its own file (e.g., `the-tavern.md`, `the-smithy.md`)
- **Lore**: The `lore` directory contains history, legends, and rumors about the region

## Formatting Rules

- **File Names**: Always use kebab-case for all files and directories (e.g., `ancient-throne-room.md`, `cursed-artifact.md`)
- **File Format**: All content must be in Markdown format with `.md` extension
- **Exception**: This CLAUDE.md file is the only exception to the kebab-case naming rule

## Content Guidelines

### Creature Design Philosophy

When creating creatures for this dungeon, adhere to these themes:

- **Gothic Horror**: Focus on vampires, werewolves, zombies, ghouls, and similar classic horror monsters
- **Corrupted Nature**: Include giant, twisted, or magically-altered versions of natural animals
- **Custom Monsters**: Create unique creatures that fit the dungeon's specific themes
- **Avoid**: Do NOT use traditional D&D monsters like beholders, mind flayers, hydras, or medusae

### Setting Context

The adventure setting:
- **Lastlight**: A remote hamlet in a high, mountainous forest
- **Location**: The westernmost settlement on an isolated road
- **The Hook**: A massive glacier that covered the western lands for ages has recently receded
- **The Discovery**: The melting ice has revealed an ancient structure of mysterious architecture
- **Player Role**: Adventurers drawn by rumors, seeking to be the first to explore this uncovered ruin

### Dungeon Level Summary

**Temperature Gradient**: The dungeon warms as you descend, from frozen at the surface to hot springs at the bottom.

- **Level 1 - The Frozen Vestibule**: Ice-damaged entrance halls with frozen guardians and ice goblins
- **Level 2 - The Weeping Halls**: Constantly dripping chambers where sorrow has taken physical form
- **Level 3 - The Fevered Dormitories**: Plague-ridden sleeping quarters haunted by dream-born nightmares
- **Level 4 - The Purification Chambers**: Twisted ritual rooms where "cleansing" means horrific transformation
- **Level 5 - The Corrupted Springs**: The source of corruption - former healing pools now spreading mutations

## OSE Compatibility

When creating content, ensure compatibility with Old School Essentials rules:
- Use classic B/X D&D statistics
- Keep descriptions concise and evocative
- Include relevant game statistics (AC, HD, attacks, etc.) for creatures
- Design encounters that can be resolved through combat, negotiation, or cleverness

## Treasure Rules

When placing treasure in the dungeon:
- **Experience from Gold**: Characters gain 1 XP per 1 gp of treasure recovered
- **Magic Item Values**: 
  - +1 weapons, armor, and protective items are worth 500 gp
  - Potions of healing are worth 100 gp
  - Spell scrolls are worth 500 gp per spell level
- **Treasure Distribution**: Follow the dungeon math guidelines in each level's overview for appropriate treasure amounts by encounter difficulty
