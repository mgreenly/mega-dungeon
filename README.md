# The Never Ending Dungeon

## Overview

This is a mega-dungeon adventure module designed for **Old School Essentials (OSE)**, set in a remote mountainous region where an ancient glacier has recently receded, revealing mysterious ruins from a forgotten age.

## The Setting

### Lastlight
A small, isolated hamlet perched high in the mountain forests, serving as the westernmost settlement on a lonely road. This remote community provides the base of operations for adventurers seeking to explore the newly-revealed ruins.

### The Discovery
For untold ages, a massive glacier covered the western lands beyond Lastlight. Recent years have seen the ice retreating, and with it has come the revelation of an ancient structure of unknown origin and strange architecture. Word of this discovery has spread, drawing adventurers from far and wide who seek to be the first to plumb its depths and claim its treasures.

## Adventure Theme

The Never Ending Dungeon presents a harrowing descent from physical cold to spiritual corruption. Beginning in the frozen vestibule where centuries of ice have preserved ancient horrors, adventurers descend through weeping halls where sorrow has taken physical form, past fevered dormitories haunted by dream-spawned nightmares, and through twisted purification chambers that transform rather than cleanse. At the dungeon's heart lie the corrupted springs - once a sacred site of healing, now a source of mutations and disease where misguided faith breached primordial seals that should have remained forever closed. As the temperature rises with each level descended, so too does the horror intensify, creating a journey from frozen preservation through emotional trauma and physical corruption to the ultimate revelation of divine transformation gone terribly wrong.

## For Game Masters

This mega-dungeon is designed with the classic principles of old-school play in mind:
