# Mega-Dungeon Project for Old School Essentials

This project defines a mega-dungeon for the Old School Essentials (OSE) tabletop role-playing game.

## Project Structure

The dungeon is organized into levels, with each level having its own directory.

-   **Dungeon Levels:** Each level of the dungeon is represented by a directory named `level-N`, where `N` is the level number (e.g., `level-1`, `level-2`).

-   **Rooms:** Within each level directory, individual rooms are described in files named `room-XX.md`, where `XX` is the room number (e.g., `room-01.md`, `room-02.md`).

-   **Lastlight:** The `lastlight` directory contains information about the hamlet that serves as the players' base of operations. Inside this directory, each file represents a specific location within the hamlet (e.g., `the-tavern.md`).

This structure allows for a clear and organized way to navigate and manage the dungeon's contents.

## File Naming Convention

All files and folders in this project should use `kebab-case` for their names. For example, `lastlight` or `the-tavern.md`. The only exception to this rule is the `GEMINI.md` file.

## File Format

All text-based content files in this project must be Markdown files with a `.md` extension.

## Creature Philosophy

This dungeon avoids traditional high-fantasy and mythological creatures (e.g., beholders, mind-flayers, hydras, medusae). The bestiary is focused on the following themes:

*   **Gothic Horror:** Classic monsters like vampires, werewolves, zombies, and ghouls are central to the dungeon's threats.
*   **Twisted or Taineted Fauna:** Expect to encounter giant, powerful, or magically altered versions of natural animals.
*   **Custom Creations:** Many creatures will be unique to this dungeon, designed to fit specific themes and encounters.

## World Overview

The adventure begins in Lastlight, a small, isolated hamlet located in a high, mountainous forest. This hamlet is the last settlement on a road heading west. For ages, the lands further west were covered by a massive glacier. However, a recent warming trend has caused the ice to recede, revealing a large, ancient structure of unknown architecture. The player characters are a group of adventurers who have journeyed to Lastlight, drawn by rumors of the newly-uncovered structure, intending to be the first to explore it.
