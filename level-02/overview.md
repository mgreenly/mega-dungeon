# Level 2: The Weeping Halls

## Theme

As the ice melts from above, this level is constantly dripping with meltwater that has awakened something strange. The water carries memories - echoes of the pilgrims who once walked these halls seeking healing. The constant moisture has created an environment where sorrow itself has taken physical form.

## History

These halls once housed the preparation chambers where pilgrims meditated on their need for healing. Countless tears were shed here as the suffering unburdened their sorrows before descending to the springs. Over centuries, this concentrated grief seeped into the very stones, and now the melting ice has awakened these preserved emotions.

## Key Elements

- **Memory Water**: Puddles and streams that show ghostly reflections of the past when disturbed
- **The Sorrowful**: Beings made of condensed grief and regret, formed from centuries of accumulated pilgrim tears
- **Crystallized Emotions**: The constant freeze-thaw cycle has created crystals that store and amplify feelings
- **Living Mold**: Black and silver fungus that feeds on despair and whispers forgotten confessions

## Unique Features

- **Vision Pools**: Rooms where stepping in water triggers visions of past tragedies
- **Weeping Statues**: Stone figures whose tears have carved channels in the floor over centuries
- **The Echo Chamber**: A vast hall where every sound becomes a mournful wail
- **Confession Cells**: Where pilgrims once unburdened themselves, now haunted by their whispered secrets
- **The Tear Gardens**: Chambers where sorrow has literally taken root, growing pale plants that weep

## Inhabitants

- **Sorrow Sprites**: Tiny elementals born from concentrated sadness
- **Memory Shades**: Ghostly echoes of pilgrims trapped in their worst moments
- **Grief Worms**: Pale creatures that burrow through walls, feeding on emotional residue
- **The Confessor**: A unique being that collects and hoards secrets
- **Melancholy Oozes**: Sentient puddles of collected tears

## Environmental Hazards

- **Melancholy Pools**: Water that saps the will to continue
- **Crying Walls**: Surfaces that weep acidic tears
- **Emotional Overflow**: Areas where feelings become overwhelming and physically manifest
- **Sorrow Fog**: Mists that induce despair and painful memories

## Special Mechanics

**Sorrow Accumulation**: Characters spending extended time here risk emotional saturation. For each hour spent on this level, save vs. paralysis or gain 1 point of Sorrow. At 3 points, movement is halved. At 5 points, overcome with grief (as Hold Person). Sorrow fades at 1 point per day of rest.

## Connections

The meltwater from Level 1 carries more than just moisture - it brings the awakening of long-dormant sorrows. These emotional waters eventually flow down to mix with the corrupted springs below, suggesting that the physical corruption of Level 5 may have roots in the spiritual anguish accumulated here.

## Wandering Monsters

5. Weeping Statue (animated)
6. No encounter

## Treasure

Memories can be valuable. Crystallized emotions can be sold to certain buyers or used as spell components. The confession cells contain forgotten secrets that may unlock treasures elsewhere. Personal effects of long-dead pilgrims occasionally surface in the flowing water.

## Narrative Purpose

This level reveals the emotional weight of the pilgrimage site - not just physical corruption but spiritual anguish preserved in the very water that flows through these halls. It serves as a psychological horror transition between the physical cold of level 1 and the bodily corruption of level 5.

## Temperature

Cold but above freezing. The air is damp and clammy, with condensation constantly forming on every surface. The temperature hovers just warm enough for water to flow freely, creating the perpetual weeping that defines these halls.
