**Description:**
The entrance hall lies in frozen ruin. Ancient pillars of black stone, cracked by centuries of ice expansion, support a vaulted ceiling thick with icicles. Frost covers every surface, and your breath mists in the frigid air. The floor is treacherous with patches of black ice beneath a thin layer of snow that has blown in through cracks in the southern entrance.

**Contents:**
**Frozen Sentinel** (1): This ancient guardian stands motionless against the eastern wall, appearing at first glance to be merely an ice-covered statue of a robed figure. When intruders approach the northern door or western corridor, frost cracks away revealing a withered corpse animated by ancient magic and preserved by centuries of ice.
