# Level 1: The Frozen Vestibule

## Theme

The entrance level represents the outermost structures that were partially exposed to centuries of glacial ice. These chambers show signs of both ancient grandeur and the ravages of freezing temperatures.

## History

These upper chambers once served as the grand entrance to the pilgrimage site, with reception halls and initial blessing chambers. When the glacier advanced centuries ago, this level bore the brunt of the ice, preserving everything in frozen stasis. Only recently has the melting begun to reveal what lies beneath the frost.

## Key Elements

- **Ice-Warped Architecture**: Stone walls show frost damage, with ice still clinging to shadowed corners
- **Frozen Guardians**: Creatures preserved in ice that may awaken as the dungeon warms
- **Glacial Remnants**: Pools of meltwater, unstable ice formations, and treacherous frozen surfaces
- **Preserved Artifacts**: Religious items and pilgrim belongings locked in ice

## Unique Features

- **The Frozen Fountain**: A grand welcoming fountain now a pillar of ice
- **Ice-Locked Doors**: Passages that require thawing to access
- **The Crystal Gallery**: Where ice has transformed windows into prismatic displays
- **Frost Gardens**: Exterior courtyards where ice formations mimic the original topiary

## Inhabitants

- **Ice Mephits**: Elemental creatures drawn to the frozen conditions
- **Frost Zombies**: Preserved corpses beginning to thaw and move
- **Ice Goblins**: Recent arrivals who've made camps in the warmer chambers
- **The Frozen Warden**: A unique guardian still at its post

## Environmental Hazards

- **Unstable Ice**: Ceiling formations that may fall
- **Slippery Surfaces**: Treacherous footing throughout
- **Freezing Pools**: Meltwater that can rapidly refreeze
- **Hypothermia Zones**: Areas cold enough to threaten life

## Special Mechanics

None specific to this level - the cold itself is the primary challenge.

## Connections

Hints at the religious nature of the complex below, with frozen murals and ice-encased statuary suggesting this was once a place of pilgrimage before the glacier claimed it. Meltwater flows down to Level 2, carrying with it the first whispers of what was preserved in the ice.

## Wandering Monsters

Roll 1d6 every 2 turns:
1. Ice Mephits (1d4)
2. Frost Zombie
3. Ice Goblin scouts (1d6)
4. Giant Ice Spider
5. Animated Ice Statue
6. No encounter

## Treasure

Frozen offerings and pilgrim possessions can be chipped from the ice. Most treasures here are religious artifacts or traveler's gear, with occasional valuable offerings meant for the springs below.

## Narrative Purpose

This level serves as a transition from the outside world into the dungeon proper, introducing players to the themes of ancient corruption slowly being revealed as the ice melts. The frozen preservation has kept some horrors dormant... but for how long?

## Temperature

Below freezing throughout, with ice formations common. The coldest level of the dungeon, requiring appropriate gear or magical protection for extended exploration. Temperature rises slightly near passages leading down, where warmer air creates condensation and slow melting.
