# Room 11: The Frozen Treasury

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Dimensions:** 30' x 30', 15' ceiling

**Entrances & Exits:**
- East door (to room 12) - heavy oak reinforced with iron bands, partially frozen shut

**Description:**
This square chamber served as a secure treasury for the pilgrimage site. The walls are lined with stone shelves and alcoves, many still holding frozen offerings. Against the western wall, what appears to be a massive formation of blue-white ice reaches from floor to ceiling, its surface smooth and translucent. Closer inspection reveals shadowy shapes within the ice - coins, gems, and other treasures seem to be suspended throughout the formation. The air here is noticeably warmer than the corridor, and condensation drips steadily from the ceiling.

**Contents:**
**The Glacier Worm** (Thawing Horror)
- **AC:** 4
- **HD:** 7 (31 hp)
- **Attacks:** 1 bite (1d8) + 1 tail slap (1d6)
- **THAC0:** 13
- **Movement:** 30' (10')
- **Save:** Fighter 7
- **Morale:** 9
- **Alignment:** Neutral
- **XP:** 850
- **Special Abilities:**
  - **Freezing Slime:** Any hit by the creature's bite attack must save vs. paralysis or be slowed (as the spell) for 1d6 rounds from the numbing cold
  - **Ice Adaptation:** Immune to cold damage, takes double damage from fire
  - **Translucent Body:** Surprises on 1-4 on 1d6 when motionless
  - **Treasure Sense:** Can detect precious metals and gems within 60'

**Appearance:** This aberrant creature resembles a massive, translucent eel or worm, 15 feet long and 3 feet thick. Its body is semi-transparent with a blue-white tinge, and objects it has swallowed can be dimly seen through its flesh. Rows of crystalline teeth line its circular maw, and thin ice constantly forms and cracks along its slimy skin.

**Tactics:** The Glacier Worm remains perfectly still, appearing as an ice formation, until warm-blooded creatures spend at least 2 rounds in the room or until someone attempts to extract treasure from the ice. It attacks by bursting from its icy shell (showering ice shards for 1d4 damage to all within 10', save vs. breath weapon for half). It prioritizes targets carrying metal objects or those attempting to take the treasure.

**Environment:** The room temperature rises noticeably once combat begins, as the creature's movement and the shattering ice release trapped air. Puddles of freezing slime make the floor slippery (movement reduced by half, save vs. paralysis or fall prone when moving at full speed).
