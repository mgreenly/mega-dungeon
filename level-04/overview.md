# Level 4: The Purification Chambers

## Theme

The level where pilgrims underwent ritual cleansing before entering the sacred springs below. These purification rites have been subtly corrupted - what appears as cleansing actually transforms the faithful in ways they don't immediately realize. The priests still believe they prepare souls for divine healing, not understanding that their rituals now open bodies and minds to the corruption waiting below.

## History

Built as the final preparation area before the sacred springs, these chambers once held a staff of devoted priests who guided pilgrims through cleansing rituals. When the corruption seeped up from below, it infiltrated their practices so gradually that the priests never noticed. They continue their holy work with complete sincerity, unaware that their blessed waters now carry subtle taints and their prayers invoke something far different than intended.

## Key Elements

- **Corrupted Sacraments**: Holy rituals that subtly prepare the body for transformation
- **The Blessed Deceived**: Priests who genuinely believe they're helping, blind to the changes they cause
- **Metamorphic Waters**: Blessed pools that seem to heal minor ailments while making deeper changes
- **Sacred Incense**: Holy smoke that calms the mind while opening it to corruption

## Unique Features

- **Preparation Chambers**: Prayer rooms where pilgrims receive "blessings" that subtly alter their flesh
- **The Pools of Renewal**: Waters that ease pain and heal wounds, while making bodies receptive to change
- **Steam Chambers**: Filled with "holy" vapors that induce religious visions and physical malleability
- **The Garden of Grace**: Where those who've undergone the rituals rest, slowly transforming
- **Confession Alcoves**: Intimate spaces where sins are forgiven and souls made "ready" for what comes below
- **The Vesting Halls**: Where blessed garments impart "divine protection" that actually marks wearers for transformation
- **Fountains of Absolution**: Sacred waters that wash away doubt along with natural resistance to corruption

## Inhabitants

- **Faithful Priests**: Devoted clerics who perform their duties with complete sincerity, unaware of what they've become
- **The Blessed**: Pilgrims in various stages of transformation who thank the priests for their "healing"
- **Purification Servants**: Temple attendants whose years of exposure have left them strangely changed
- **Incense Bearers**: Acolytes who breathe the sacred smoke and speak in voices not quite their own
- **The High Confessor**: The eldest priest who remembers the old ways but can no longer see how they've changed
- **Grateful Penitents**: Those who've undergone the rituals and now eagerly await their descent to the springs

## Environmental Hazards

- **Blessed Vapors**: Holy mists that bring peace while subtly altering perception
- **Waters of Grace**: Pools that heal superficial wounds but leave deeper marks
- **Cleansing Light**: Sacred flames that feel warm and comforting while changing what they touch
- **Overwhelming Peace**: Areas of such serenity that visitors lose the will to leave or resist

## Special Mechanics

**The Purification Process**: Appears to follow traditional holy rites:
1. **Confession**: Unburdening of sins that actually opens the soul to influence
2. **Ablution**: Ritual bathing that cleanses while making the body malleable
3. **Anointing**: Sacred oils that smell of roses while seeping corruption into the skin
4. **Vestment**: Donning blessed robes that gradually merge with the wearer
5. **Benediction**: Final blessing that feels like divine grace while sealing one's fate

## Connections

The dream-sick from Level 3 would descend here, believing the purification chambers could cure them. Instead, the rituals prepared their fevered bodies for the final transformation in the springs below. The steam and vapors rising from Level 5 fill these chambers, creating the mutagenic atmosphere. Many of the mechanical devices here connect directly to the pools below.

## Wandering Monsters

Roll 1d6 every 2 turns:
1. Faithful Priests (1d2) performing blessings
2. Grateful Pilgrims (1d4) praising the rituals
3. Purification Servant carrying holy items
4. Incense Bearers (1d3) spreading blessed smoke
5. The Blessed (1d6) in various stages of change
6. No encounter

## Treasure

Holy relics and ceremonial items of great value (subtly corrupted), blessed oils and healing salves (with hidden effects), prayer books and scrolls of benediction (that invoke unintended powers), and the accumulated offerings of grateful pilgrims. The vestment chambers contain robes woven with gold and silver threads that seem to move on their own.

## Narrative Purpose

This level reveals the insidious nature of the corruption - not through violence or obvious horror, but through sincere faith turned unknowingly wrong. The true horror lies in the priests' genuine belief that they're helping, and the pilgrims' gratitude for their "healing." It shows how corruption can wear the mask of holiness, preparing visitors for the springs below not through force, but through their own eager participation in their transformation.

## Temperature

Warm and humid, with a comforting heat that feels like a gentle embrace. The air is thick with sweet incense and healing vapors that rise from below. The warmth seems to ease aches and pains, making visitors drowsy and compliant. What feels like divine warmth is actually the first touch of the corruption rising from the springs below.
