# Level 4: The Purification Chambers

## Theme

The level where pilgrims underwent ritual cleansing before entering the sacred springs below. Now these purification rites have become grotesque parodies - the chambers transform flesh rather than cleanse it, preparing bodies for the corrupted baptism that awaits. What was once a place of spiritual preparation has become a factory of flesh.

## History

Built as the final preparation area before the sacred springs, these chambers once held a staff of devoted priests who guided pilgrims through cleansing rituals. When the corruption was released from below, these priests were the first to embrace it, believing it to be a new form of divine blessing. They modified their rituals to "perfect" rather than purify, turning sacred rites into horrific transformations.

## Key Elements

- **Twisted Rituals**: Cleansing ceremonies that now strip away humanity rather than impurity
- **The Penitent**: Former priests and attendants fused with their purification tools
- **Metamorphic Waters**: Pre-corrupted pools that cause controlled mutations
- **Living Censers**: Breathing apparatus that filter corruption into the air

## Unique Features

- **Preparation Chambers**: Rooms with surgical altars for "improving" pilgrims before their descent
- **The Flaying Pools**: Where skin was ritually removed to "purify" the flesh beneath
- **Steam Chambers**: Filled with mutagenic vapors rising from below
- **The Garden of New Forms**: Where "purified" beings display their transformations
- **Confession Engines**: Mechanical devices that extract sin through physical manipulation
- **The Vesting Halls**: Where ceremonial garments now graft themselves to flesh
- **Purge Fountains**: Once for ritual washing, now spray caustic transformation fluids

## Inhabitants

- **Surgeon-Priests**: Mad clerics who still perform their "sacred" duties
- **The Flayed**: Skinless beings who seek new flesh to wear
- **Purification Golems**: Constructs of soap, salt, and bone that scour everything
- **Incense Wraiths**: Vaporous beings that inhabit the smoke-filled chambers
- **The High Cleanser**: A unique being that oversees the transformation process
- **Penitent Crawlers**: Those undergoing "purification" who drag themselves between chambers

## Environmental Hazards

- **Caustic Mists**: Cleaning vapors that dissolve organic matter
- **Transformation Pools**: Waters that cause specific, controlled mutations
- **Purity Flames**: White fires that burn away "imperfections"
- **Confession Chambers**: Rooms that physically extract secrets and sins

## Special Mechanics

**The Purification Process**: Follows twisted versions of the original rites:
1. **Confession**: Physical extraction of sin through mechanical devices
2. **Ablution**: Bathing in mutagenic waters
3. **Flaying**: Removal of "impure" flesh
4. **Vestment**: Donning of transformative garments
5. **Benediction**: Final "blessing" that completes the change

## Connections

The dream-sick from Level 3 would descend here, believing the purification chambers could cure them. Instead, the rituals prepared their fevered bodies for the final transformation in the springs below. The steam and vapors rising from Level 5 fill these chambers, creating the mutagenic atmosphere. Many of the mechanical devices here connect directly to the pools below.

4. Incense Wraiths (1d4)
5. Penitent Crawlers (1d6)
6. No encounter

## Treasure

Ceremonial items of great value (though often cursed), surgical instruments made of precious metals, transformative elixirs and salves, and the accumulated offerings of those seeking purification. The vestment chambers contain robes woven with gold and silver threads.

## Narrative Purpose

This level reveals the deliberate nature of the corruption - not mere disease or decay, but a conscious transformation process. The horror shifts from infection to intentional bodily modification, preparing visitors for the "blessed" mutations of Level 5. It shows that the corruption below isn't accidental but part of a twisted religious practice.

## Temperature

Warm and humid, with scalding steam in many areas. The heat increases noticeably as one descends, and the air is thick with incense, chemical vapors, and the steam rising from the corrupted springs below. The temperature varies from uncomfortably warm to areas of blistering heat near the purification devices. The oppressive atmosphere makes it clear that the infernal springs are very close.
