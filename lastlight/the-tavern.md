# The End of the Road

**Proprietor: Elara Vance**

Elara possesses a quiet, unassuming grace that seems out of place in the rustic tavern. Her features are fine and well-proportioned, though often set in a neutral, unreadable expression. She moves with an economy of motion that suggests formal training of some kind, and her posture is unnaturally straight, even when she's wiping down a table.

## Exterior

From the road, the tavern is unremarkableâ€”a simple timber-frame building with a fieldstone foundation, indistinguishable from the other hamlet dwellings. There is no sign, only a single, well-made lantern hanging by the door, which is kept lit from dusk until midnight, serving as the only indication of the building's purpose.

## Interior

The common room is dominated by a large stone hearth that crackles with a welcoming fire, casting a warm, flickering light across the room. The furniture is a collection of mismatched but sturdy wooden tables and chairs. Faded tapestries depicting unfamiliar landscapes hang on the walls, absorbing sound and adding a layer of insulation against the cold.
